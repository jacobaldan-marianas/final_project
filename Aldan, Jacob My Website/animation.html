    <h2>The App I use</h2>
    <h5>Drawing Cartoons 2</h5>
    <img src="images/drawingcartoons2.png" alt="Drawing Cartoons 2">
    <p>Drawing Cartoons 2 is a free app I got in the app store that allows me to do basic 2d animations.</p>
    &nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <p>Here are videos showing my process in creating my animations.</p>
    &nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    <h3>1. Setting Up the Scene</h3>
    <p>First, I enter the Drawing Cartoons 2 app. Then I tap on new cartoon. From there, my first step is to pick a background. Once I have picked a background, <br> I then add in elements like characters and objects that I want to have in my scene.
    For this explaination I will only pick a stick figure.</p>

      &nbsp;
      &nbsp;
      <h3>2. Adding Movement</h3>
      <p>Once the scene is set up, I begin on creating simple movements for my stick figure.</p>

      &nbsp;
      &nbsp;
      &nbsp;
      <h3>3. Adding Additional Things</h3>
      <p>After adding movements, I now add extra elements to the animation to give it life.</p>

      <h3>Exporting It to My Phone Gallery</h3>

      <h2>Did they have any story?</h2>
      <p>There was some kind of narrative I had for these videos, but I ended up forgetting it.<br>
    This encouraged me to write down any stories that come up in my head.<br>
These videos are the last ones I made with the old narrative (part of the reason on why I probably forgot about it was because it wasn't any good).</p>
